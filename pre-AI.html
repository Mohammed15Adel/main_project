            <h1>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence from its Early Beginnings to the Present Day</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its early beginnings. In the 1950s, AI was a theoretical concept with little practical application. However, in the decades since then, AI has become increasingly sophisticated and is now used in a wide variety of applications.</p>
            <div class="video-border">
                <h1>Early AI</h1>
                <p>The first AI research was focused on developing machines that could simulate human intelligence. This led to the development of expert systems, which are computer programs that use knowledge and rules to solve problems. Expert systems were used in a variety of applications, including medical diagnosis and financial planning.</p>

                <h1>Neural Networks</h1>
                <p>In the 1980s, there was a resurgence of interest in AI, driven by the development of neural networks. Neural networks are computer programs that are inspired by the structure of the human brain. They are able to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. Neural networks have been used in a variety of applications, including image recognition and natural language processing.</p>

                <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
                <p>In the 2010s, there was another breakthrough in AI with the development of deep learning. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Deep learning has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation.</p>

                <h1>The beginning</h1>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) has a long and fascinating history, dating back to the early days of computing. In the 1950s, the field of AI was founded by a group of scientists and mathematicians who were interested in creating machines that could think and behave like humans.
                    One of the most important figures in the early history of AI was Alan Turing. In 1950, Turing published a paper called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed a test to determine whether a machine could be considered intelligent. This test, now known as the Turing test, is still used today as a benchmark for AI research.
